What social problem is being addressed?

We are looking to address the issue of limited social protections of queer populations internationally. We are specifically looking to highlight various legal protections afforded to LGBTQ+ communities and how these communities are affected by and respond to their circumstances.

Who is being empowered by your mapplication?

We are hoping to empower and provide awareness to international LGBTQ+ communities who are not afforded legal protections.

What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?

In developing this tool, we must be careful not to depict communities as incapable of uplifting themselves, but rather highlight their uniqueness and their perserverence in their particular situations. We must also be sure not to lead with a "savior" mindset. Technical/practical problems could arise in getting contact with such communities.
